# exposure_fusion
Group project for MVA 2018 course "Introduction to Numerical Imaging"

We propose a python3 implementation of the exposure fusion algorithm based on laplacian pyramid computation.
The method that is implemented is based on the paper "Exposure Fusion" by Tom Mertens et al.

The file utils.py gathers all the useful functions to run the algorithm, and the jupyter notebook experiments.ipynb shows examples pf experiments. A sample of pictures with increasing exposure times is available in the pictures/room/ directory.
